        Tax for free rider mutable (and untruncated) is ALWAYS 1y/0x elastic, by
        laborless-demand bearing (as services are free rider immutable, sewage,
        police and lawsuits). Unless it is plundering (and not for firesale),
        does it reduce inequality by assets (and increased efficiency, 0y/1x
        1/hour-GDP/p).

        Instead of leases, which seems to come into oil price, have royalties
        per barrel, at current product minus input costs; us Savers can set the
        overhead on drilling up to, now 3.65%/yr, - input costs, if we charge by
        royalty of sales, so shipping outside of North Dakota, Wyoming, New
        Mexico and the other one. Pennsylvania and Texas has bunch of private
        lots, 23.6% 2017 share, but that was 10m/day now is 18m/day, 600k/day
        imports and exports, why? Are we washing money here. 2024nj.com

        20% of $5.4/day for every $10k of checking, instead of taking out oil,
        just royalties structured like this. Is it per person? Maybe deflate it
        by half after per capita of that 18m product, added, either case, it it
        better than the treasury getting that money, because we know free rider
        mutable and untruncated is 1y/0x elastic, for the services are sewage,
        police and lawsuits, unless it is plundering that you aren’t fire
        selling, elastic again as much as subsidies beyond free rider
        immutables, if input costs are complimentary substitutes as currency,
        fungible for state lands
